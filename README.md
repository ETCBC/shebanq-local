## Status

**The days of shebanq.ancient-data.org as a website are numbered.**

**At some point in the (near) future shebanq will be shut down.**

**However, all public data in it has been curated
and this repo makes it available to you.**

**You can run shebanq on your own computer for personal use,
with the latest data loaded.**

**You can find here the metadata of all
[published queries](https://etcbc.github.io/shebanq-local/index.html)**

**Finally, you can download the
[results of all published queries](content/qresults.tfx)
and view them in the Text-Fabric browser.**

## About

*System for HEBrew Text: ANnotations for Queries and Markup*

[SHEBANQ](https://shebanq.ancient-data.org)
was, until ??-??-20?? a website with a search engine for the Hebrew Bible, powered by the
[BHSA](https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa)
linguistic database, also known as ETCBC or WIVU.

The ETCBC is lead by
[prof. dr. Willem Th. van Peursen](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/willem-van-peursen).

## History

SHEBANQ was first deployed in 2014, by DANS, for the ETCBC, in the context of CLARIN.

The evolution of SHEBANQ till now can be seen in
[ETCBC/shebanq](https://github.com/ETCBC/shebanq)
which reflects the history of SHEBANQ since October 2017.
It still contains the documentation and lots of useful information.

As of 2023-12-21 SHEBANQ migrated to KNAW/HuC in the context of CLARIAH,
which acts as the successor of CLARIN.

On 2026-03-01 the maker of SHEBANQ, retired. This repository is a curated version
of SHEBANQ.
It contains the resources to set up a local shebanq on your computer which contains
all the public material that users have contributed over time until the moment
of curation.

## Local deployment

These are the steps to **get your own shebanq**:

1.  Install a docker engine (we recommend [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io)
    but [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is also an
    excellent choice.

1.  Start a bash shell and verify that it can do the `git` command

    ```
    git --version
    ```

1.  Clone this repository:

    ```
    cd to/your/directory/of/choice
    git clone https://github.com/ETCBC/shebanq-local.git
    cd shebanq-local

1.  Start the local shebanq server by

    ```
    ./shebanq.sh up
    ```

    (which is an abbreviation for `docker compose up`)

1.  Open a bash shell in the same directory and do

    ```
    ./shebanq.sh browse
    ```

    and now a browser window opens with the shebanq website in it.

## Inspect query results in the TF browser

Without setting up your own local shebanq, you can still view the results of
published queries in the Text-Fabric browser.
These are the steps to do that:

1.  Install [Python](https://www.python.org)

1.  Start a bash shell and verify that it can do the `git` command

    ```
    git --version
    ```

1.  Clone this repository:

    ```
    cd to/your/directory/of/choice
    git clone https://github.com/ETCBC/shebanq-local.git
    cd shebanq-local


1.  Install [Text-Fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric) by
    
    ```
    pip install 'text-fabric[all]'
    ```

1.  Start the TF browser and load the query results:

    ```
    tf ETCBC/bhsa sets=content/qresults.tfx
    ```

1.  In the search box, enter the id and version of a query.
