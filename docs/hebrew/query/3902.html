<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>In an attempt to find Passive Qal forms in the database ('vs = pqal' gives only 6 results in version 2017, so it is likely inconsistent), we may look to all those forms that have Pu'al qatal or Hif'il yiqtol, and also occur in Qal.
Passive Qal looks in the qatal exactly like Pu'al and in the yiqtol like Hof'al. Therefore, the database does not recognize Passive Qal. Yet, when the stem of a Pu'al or Hif'il exists in Qal too, we have a candidate for Passive Qal. Manual post-processing may then determine whether or not we have an actual Passive Qal.
Ideally we would look explicitly to those Pu'als and Hof'als that have no Pi'el or Hif'il form. These would not include all Passive Qals, but would give a closer approximation of actual Passive Qals. Unfortunately such a requirement cannot be formulated in MQL ('vs&lt;&gt;hif' or 'vs&lt;&gt;piel' in the first blocks would not do this, as it includes any stem that happens to be not Hif'il or Pi'el, rather than that the stem does not exist in Hif'il or Pi'el).</p>
<p>This query reduces all 919 Hof'als and Pu'als to a list of 272 forms that can possibly be a Passive Qal. As said, many may not acually be Passive Qal. Manual post-processing is needed to determine these forms that are (likely) Passive Qals.</p>
